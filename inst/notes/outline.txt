graphicsQC: An R package providing quality control tools for graphics. 
The package provides functions to generate graphics files, compare 
them with "model" files, and report the results.

Three main functions are used, as well as a main control function to 
organise input for suitable use by the main functions.
The three main functions are;
plotExpr,
compare,
writeReport,
and the control function: graphicsQC.

Basically:
plotExpr will take an R expression (or expressions) and produce plots 
in specific file formats of the intended plot(s).
compare will take two(?) (sets of) image files of the same format and identify 
any differences in the files.
writeReport will produce a HTML output of any differences found from 
the compare function.

graphicsQC can perform all three functions. It will take any R expression, 
list of R expressions, blocks of code, or even a package, and can then 
perform any (or all) of the three functions on them.
