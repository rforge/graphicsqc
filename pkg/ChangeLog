* NAMESPACE: created

* compare.R 
	(writeXmlCompareExprLog): Writes blank results nicely.
	               Writes unpaired according to test/control.
	               Writes test and control info too.
	               (Note: Still needs to readPlotExprLog them).
	               Writes overall result.
	(compareType): Checks to see if there's anything to compare first.
	               Removes automatic names for 'round trip'.
	(compareExpr): Includes test and control info in result. 
	               Includes 'overall' result (include there are unpaired?).
	(comparePNG): Fixed to only return the diffPlot name if it made one.
	(GNUdiff): Fixed output redirection so all blanks get deleted.
	(readPlotExprLog): Reads overall result.

* tests.R
	(): made 'blank' tests and updated miscellaneous tests.

* plotFile.Rd 
	(): Changed note about opening graphics device to warning

* plotFunction.Rd 
	(): Likewise.

* makeplots.R 
	(getAbsolutePath): Removed and replaced with 
	normalizePath(path.expand()) in plotFunction.
	(plotFunction): 
	Set to use only the first prefix when naming the XML log file.
	(plotFile): Likewise.
	(readPlotExprLog): Now reads logFilename.
	(writeXmlPlotExprLog): Now writes logFilename too.
	(writeXmlPlotFunLog): New function.
	(writeXmlPlotTypeLog): refactored (and renamed) so plotFile can use it too.

* compare.R 
	(getDiffName): Changed to use basename.
	(comparePDF, comparePNG, compareBMP, comparePS, GNUdiff):
	return list results
	(compareExpr): Sets names for the resulting list.
	(compareType): Set to use SIMPLIFY = FALSE to return a list. 
	Reordered calls to other compare functions so it's: test, control, 
	for consistency.
	(writeXMLCompareExprLog): New function.
	(getCompareExprLogFilename): Likewise.

* plotFile.Rd 
	(): Brief/skeleton documentation created.

* plotFunction.Rd 
	(): Likewise.

* tests.R 
	(): Updated some tests.
