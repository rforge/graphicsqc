2007-11-10  Stephen Gardiner  <sgar060@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

* DESCRIPTION: Changed the name of the package to ``graphicsQC''.

* tests.R
	(): Replaced ``graphicsqc'' with ``graphicsQC''.

* graphicsqc-package.Rd: Renamed to graphicsQC-package.Rd

2007-10-31  Stephen Gardiner  <sgar060@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

* report.Rnw: Updated. Includes bullet points and some content written.

2007-10-30  Stephen Gardiner  <sgar060@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

* makeplots.R, compare.R, report.R, log.R
	(): All function names have been backquoted and laid out similar to what
		dump would do. Many of the comments have also been tidied.

* makeplots.R
	(): Changed from stop() when length(prefix) > 1 to warning().
	(evalPlotCode): Strips trailing \n from warnings and errors (so XML will
		read properly). Note: writing/reading using CData also won't read the
		last \n's.
	(plotFile): Re-ordered arguments so path comes before prefix because prefix
		normally has sensible defaults.
	(plotFunction): Likewise.
	(plotExpr): Likewise (except prefix has to be chosen by the user).

* tests.R
	(): Changed calls to plotExpr/plotFile/plotFunction to match change in
		ordering of arguments.

* log.R
	(getQCResult): When auto-detecting for the highest classed object, if
		many are detected, now gives a warning and calls notYetImplemented().

* compareExpr.xsl:
	(): Changed to "Warnings/Errors Differences" rather than
		'Warnings/Errors Comparisons'.

* compareFunAndFile.xsl:
	(): Changed to "Warnings/Errors Differences" rather than
		'Warnings/Errors Comparisons'.

* NAMESPACE: Changed print.qcPlotExprResult and print.qcCompareExprResult
		to use S3method().
		Defined S3method()s for report.* (qcPlotExprResult, qcPlotFileResult,
		qcPlotFunResult, qcCompareExprResult, qcCompareFileResult,
		qcCompareFunResult, default).

* plotExpr.Rd: Updated/fleshed out.

* compare.Rd: Updated/fleshed out.

* plotFile.Rd: Removed - merged into plotExpr.Rd.

* plotFunction.Rd: Removed - merged into plotExpr.Rd.

* graphicsqc-package.Rd: Updated/a little fleshed out.

2007-10-23  Stephen Gardiner  <sgar060@aucklanduni.ac.nz>

* report.R
	(): Uses getQCResult so can auto-detect.
	(report): New generic function
	(report.qcPlotExprResult, report.qcPlotFileResult, report.qcPlotFunResult,
	 report.qcCompareExprResult, report.qcCompareFileResult,
	 report.qcCompareFunResult, report.default): New functions (refactored code).
	 
* log.R
	(getQCResult): Added argument for 'which' so can be used to auto-detect
		all log files, or just plot ones.

* NAMESPACE: Added print.qcPlotExprResult and print.qcCompareExprResult.

* compareFunAndFile.xsl: TOC only reports numbers of differences.
		Comparison logs section removed. All 'Files' are listed with links to
		their respective logs. New 'No plots to compare' section.

* makeplots.R
	(print.qcPlotExprResult) Changed to match arguments of the print generic.

* compare.R
	(print.qcCompareExprResult) Changed to match arguments of the print generic.
	
* gridExample2.tar.gz: New File.

		'getRversion()' to 'version$version.string' (more informative).
	(evalPlotCode): Removed the text "Warning in evalPlotCode:" from being
		appended on to every warning.
		Likewise for "Error in evalPlotCode:".

* compare.R
	(): Relaxed 'erase' to default to "none" and give a warning if invalid input
		given.
		Changed to check for path until AFTER reading the log in as it may
		have been a character vector.
	(compareExpr, compareFunOrFile): Changed R version in info from
		'getRversion()' to 'version$version.string' (more informative).

* compare.Rd
	(): Changed argument listing to match function (path changed).

* writeReport.R
	(): Also passes xslStyleSheets when recursing for sub-types.
	
* compareFunAndFile.xsl
	(): Fixed bug where "Warnings" and "Errors" column in Warnings/Errors
		comparisons	table would not be correctly sized if the warnings/errors
		didn't occur in the first file.
		Added unpaired (for unpaireds in the compareExpr Logs).

* compareExpr.xsl
	(unpaired): Includes links to plots in "Plots" section.

* DESCRIPTION: Changed 'Sxslt' to "Suggests" instead of "Depends"

* tests.R
	(): Added test to check if Sxslt can be loaded before writeReport is called.
	
* gridExample.tar.gz: New File.

		result.
	(readCompareFunLog): Now also reads 'info' from qcCompareFunResult files.

	(plotFunction, plotFile): Also include their own info.
	(plotFunction): Included test to make sure prefixes are unique.
		
* log.R
	(writeXmlCompareTypeLog): Reads path from the result object rather than as
		an argument. Now writes info.
	(writeXmlPlotTypeLog): Writes info too.
	(readPlotFunLog): Also reads info.
	(readCompareExprLog): Fixed a follow on from the bug listed above (under
		compare.R (compareWarnings)).

* writeReport.R
	(): Added new argument "xslStyleSheets" which is a list to let users
		overwrite a default XSL style sheet if they want.

* writeReport.Rd: Included new argument (xslStyleSheets).

* plotExpr.xsl: Added some comments.
		Plots now have their own cell in the table.
